				<h3>the filemanager</h3>
				<div>
					<table class="accordion_tb">
						<tr>
							<td>The filemanager is a simple staging area that will keep your files organized as you work. Start by creating a folder named filemanager on your desktop. Place 5 empty folders inside of it and name them "archive", "large", "ms", "regular", and "thumb".</td>
							<td><img src="{% static 'img/docs/deploy/fm_root.png' %}" /></td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>Inside of the <i>archive</i> directory, place two more empty folders. Name one "processor", and name the other with today's date (using the numerical format displayed at right). <br />Congratulations &ndash; you've created your filemanager!</td><td><img src="{% static 'img/docs/deploy/fma.png' %}" /></td>
						</tr>
					</table>
				</div>
				<h3>preparing product images</h3>
				<div>
					product images are normally obtained either from vendor sites (eg. nike.net, adobe scene, etc...), from vendors via buyers, or from our image studio (EyeMagic). <br /><br />
					<h3><span class="bold"> if...</span></h3> your images are from studio:<br />
					proceed to next step: <span class="bold">building</span><br /><br />

					<h3><span class="bold"> else...</span></h3>
					images from vendors must be prepped and versioned according to Big 5 specifications for export to our print and web servers. Specific information for the image preparation and versioning process is located <a href="#">here.</a><br />

					<table class="accordion_tb">
						<tr>
							<td>After your vendor images have been prepped and versioned, the web versions should be placed in the filemanger &ndash; in the proper version folders...</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td><img src="{% static 'img/docs/deploy/web_folder.png' %}" /></td>

							<td>and the .eps files placed in the processor. The proper folder hierarchy is displayed below...</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td><img src="{% static 'img/docs/deploy/eps_folder.png' %}" /></td>
						</tr>
					</table>
					Because you've already built your folder structure in the filemanager and your web filenames are not yet sequenced, you can now skip steps 3 and 4 and proceed to step 5: <span class="bold">sequencing</span><br />

				</div>
				<h3>building</h3>
				<div>
					<table class="accordion_tb">
						<tr>
							<td class="extra_clearance"><div class="half_copy_box">Unzip your EyeMagic image archive. We'll need to build our filemanager version directories. Open a terminal window and type builder.py. Builder wants the path to your print images. On mac systems, you can just drag and drop the "Print" folder onto the terminal window (faster than typing :-). Then press enter.</div><img src="{% static 'img/docs/deploy/builder/build_fig1.png' %}" /></td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td class="extra_clearance"><div class="half_copy_box">Now the builder wants to know where you want your new directory. It's programmed to start in ...filemanager/archive, so if you just type "processor", it will find it. Type "processor" and hit enter.</div>

						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td class="extra_clearance"><div class="half_copy_box">Finally the builder wants to know what to name your new print folder.

						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td><div class="half_copy_box">Voila! Check your processor and you'll see that your print folders and subfolders have been created and the printfiles have been copied from the archive into their respective sku folders.</div><img src="{% static 'img/docs/deploy/builder/build_finished.png' %}" /</td>
						</tr>
					</table>
				</div>
				<h3>stripping</h3>
				<div>
					Now for the webfiles. The EyeMagic files come with the filenames preformatted and sequenced. However, the studio doesn't have real-time information regarding what's on our servers, so occasionally, their sequence information isn't up to date. No worries. In this step we'll quickly strip the webfiles of their sequence information; and in the next step we'll re-sequence, using real-time server data.<br /><br />
					<table class="accordion_tb">
						<tr>
							<td class="extra_clearance"><div class="half_copy_box">In your terminal enter "stripper.py". On mac systems, drag the "Web" folder onto the terminal window and press enter.</div><img src="{% static 'img/docs/deploy/stripper/stripper_fig1.png' %}" /></td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td class="extra_clearance"><div class="half_copy_box">The stripper removes the sequencing and formatting from the web files.</div>
							<img src="{% static 'img/docs/deploy/stripper/stripper_fig2.png' %}" /></td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td class="extra_clearance"><div class="half_copy_box">Rename the "small" folder inside of your Web folder to "ms". Then you can add your webfiles to their proper locations in your filemanager. (Most often, the easiest thing to do is simply overwrite your filemanager web folders, with the new ones from your archive &mdash; as shown below)</div>

				<h3>sequencing</h3>
				<div>
					<table class="accordion_tb">

							<div class="half_copy_box clear_both">The sequence software checks each filename against the fileserver.

				<h3>checking</h3>
				<div>
					At this point we're almost ready to deploy but first, lets do a quick check so that we can resolve any potential conflicts up front.
					<table class="accordion_tb">

							<td class="extra_clearance"><div class="half_copy_box">Inspecting the output from the sequencer, we can see that the first image has been assigned number 05 in the product sequence.</div><img src="{% static 'img/docs/deploy/housekeeping/new/hs_fig1.png' %}" /></td>

						<tr>
							<td class="extra_clearance"><div class="half_copy_box">This means that for sku# 1050 10668 0004, there is at least an 02, 03 and 04 version already on the fileserver. If any of those files also contain the color way "015", we will have a conflict because we are trying to deploy <i>to</i> server something that already exists <i>on</i> server. We can check either by entering our sku# into the imagetrac file searcher:</div><img src="{% static 'img/docs/deploy/housekeeping/new/hs_fig3.png' %}" />
							<img src="{% static 'img/docs/deploy/housekeeping/new/hs_fig4.png' %}" /></td>

						<tr>
							<td class="extra_clearance"><div class="half_copy_box">Or by using the searche utility (enter searche.py into your terminal.)</div><img src="{% static 'img/docs/deploy/housekeeping/new/hs_fig2.png' %}" /><div class="half_copy_box" style="margin-top:10px;">Both tools alert us that we do indeed have pre-existing "1050_10668_0004_015"s on the server. In these cases both old and new images will need to be evaluated to determine which to keep, remove, rename, and/or deploy as the particular case may dictate. The imagetrac browser tool is a useful visual aid and the "remover" and "renamer" terminal utilities are also useful in resolving image conflicts.<br /><br />Once you have inspected your sequencer output and confirmed you have no remaining conflicts, you are ready to deploy. </div></td>
